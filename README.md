#Explore US Bikeshare Data
I used **Python** to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the US. I wrote code to **import the data** and answer questions by computing **descriptive statistics**. My script takes raw **user input** to create an **interactive experience** in the terminal to present these statistics.
