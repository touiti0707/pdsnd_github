#Explore US Bikeshare Data
I used **Python** to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the US. I wrote code to **import the data** and answer questions by computing **descriptive statistics**. My script takes raw **user input** to create an **interactive experience** in the terminal to present these statistics.

The statistics computed are :
####Popular times of travel
* most common month
* most common day of week
* most common hour of day

####Popular stations and trip
* most common start station 
* most common end station
* most common trip from start to end (i.e. most frequent combination of start station and end station)

####Trip duration 
* total travel time
* average travel time

####User info
* counts of each user type
* counts of each gender
* earliest, most recent, most common year of birth

#Files used
I used three datasets : 
* chicago.csv,
* new_york_city.csv
* washington.csv

All three of the data files contain the same core six columns:
* Start Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:07:57)
* End Time  (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:20:53)
* Trip Duration (in seconds - e.g., 776)
* Start Station  (e.g., Broadway & Barry Ave)
* End Station  (e.g., Sedgwick St & North Ave)
* User Type (Subscriber or Customer)

The Chicago and New York City files also have the following two columns:
* Gender
* Birth Year

#Software requirements
You should have **Python 3, NumPy, and pandas** installed using Anaconda
A text editor like Sublime or Atom
A terminal application
