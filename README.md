#Explore US Bikeshare Data
I used **Python** to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the US. I wrote code to **import the data** and answer questions by computing **descriptive statistics**. My script takes raw **user input** to create an **interactive experience** in the terminal to present these statistics.

The statistics computed are :
####Popular times of travel
* most common month
* most common day of week
* most common hour of day

####Popular stations and trip
* most common start station 
* most common end station
* most common trip from start to end (i.e. most frequent combination of start station and end station)

####Trip duration 
* total travel time
* average travel time

####User info
* counts of each user type
* counts of each gender
* earliest, most recent, most common year of birth
